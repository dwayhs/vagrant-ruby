#Vagrant Ruby

###How to use:

- clone this project;
- install [vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com) and [virtual box](http://www.virtualbox.org);
- run ```vagrant up``` on your command line and wait for your VM to boot. IÂ´ll take a while in the first time. 
- run ```vagrant ssh``` to connect to the VM
- run ```vagrant halt``` to shutdown the VM and ```vagrant up``` to bring it back.
